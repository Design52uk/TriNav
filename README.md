© 2025 Mark — All Rights Reserved.

## 🔷 What Is TriNav?

TriNav™ consists of:

- A 3-phase sidebar:
  - **Phase 0:** Closed  
  - **Phase 1:** Mini mode (icon-only)  
  - **Phase 2:** Full sidebar (icons + labels)

- A hybrid control icon:
  - Hamburger lines
  - Dual arrows indicating state progression
  - Visual colour-cue logic that matches each phase

- A one-time onboarding hint:
  *“Tap again for full.”*

- A structured state machine:
  Icon phase is tied to the sidebar state (0 → 1 → 2 → 0).
